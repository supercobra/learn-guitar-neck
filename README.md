# Learn Guitar Neck

This is a simple bash script that prints a random letter from the set {E, A, D, G, B, E} every three seconds. The script is designed to ensure that the same letter is not printed twice in a row. Great to practice notes memorization of the guitar neck.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have bash installed on your system. This is typically available by default on most Unix-like systems, including Linux distributions and macOS.

2. Clone this repository or download the `find-note.sh` script.

3. Give the script execute permissions. You can do this by navigating to the directory containing the script and running the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod +x find-note.sh
    ```

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./find-note.sh
    ```

The script will run indefinitely until you stop it. You can stop the script by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
